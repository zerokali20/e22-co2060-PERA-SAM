## 📖 Introduction

PERA-SAM (Predictive Equipment Reliability & Acoustics - Sound Analysis Manager) is a centralized acoustic management system designed to listen to the "heartbeat" of machines.

Traditional maintenance is reactive—fixing things only after they break. PERA-SAM shifts this to a predictive model. By processing acoustic signatures using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and MFCC, the system detects subtle frequency shifts caused by friction, imbalances, or wear before catastrophic failure occurs.

Currently prototyped for laptop cooling fans, server fans, engine fans, this system is designed to scale up to heavy industrial machinery and vehicle engines.
